# Ham-Fisted
Built on Unity 2021.3.9f1 using URP, Photon Pun 2, and Playfab.
# The Project
The goal for this assignment was to work as a group to create a functioning multiplayer game with a leaderboard and player authentication system. I chose to take inspiration from a minigame from Super Monkey Ball to create a simple, 3D platform fighter.  
It was later extended into a new version found here: https://github.com/JeffcoatDesign/Ham-Fisted-2.0
